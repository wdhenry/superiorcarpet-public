                    The following Privacy Policy governs the online information collection practices of <b>Superior Carpet &amp; Upholstery Care</b>. 
                    Specifically, it outlines the types of information that we gather about you while you are using the website, and the ways in which 
                    we use this information. This Privacy Policy, including our children’s privacy statement, does not apply to any information you may 
                    provide to us or that we may collect offline and/or through other means (for example, at a live event, via telephone, or through the mail).
                    
                    <h4>How We Collect and Use Information</h4>
                    We may collect and store personal or other information that you voluntarily supply to us online while using the Site (e.g., while on 
                    the Site or in responding via email to a feature provided on the Site). We use the information we collect from you while you are using
                    the Site in a variety of ways, including using the information to customize features and advertising that appear on the Site and gathering 
                    information that better allows us to provide our services.
                    
                    <h4>Children’s Privacy Statement</h4>
                    This children’s privacy statement explains our practices with respect to the online collection and use of personal information from 
                    children under the age of thirteen, and provides important information regarding their rights under federal law with respect to such 
                    information.  
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            This Site is not directed to children under the age of thirteen and we do NOT knowingly collect personally identifiable information 
                            from children under the age of thirteen as part of the Site. We screen users who wish to provide personal information in order to prevent 
                            users under the age of thirteen from providing such information. If we become aware that we have inadvertently received personally 
                            identifiable information from a user under the age of thirteen as part of the Site, we will delete such information from our records. 
                            If we change our practices in the future, we will obtain prior, verifiable parental consent before collecting any personally identifiable 
                            information from children under the age of thirteen as part of the Site.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Because we do not collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen as part of the Site, we also 
                            do NOT knowingly distribute such information to third parties.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            We do NOT knowingly allow children under the age of thirteen to publicly post or otherwise distribute personally identifiable contact 
                            information through the Site.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Because we do not collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen as part of the Site, we do 
                            NOT condition the participation of a child under thirteen in the Site’s online activities on providing personally identifiable information.
                        </li>
