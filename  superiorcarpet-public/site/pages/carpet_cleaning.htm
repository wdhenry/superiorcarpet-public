                    <h3>Carpet Cleaning</h3>
                	<p>Since 2005, <b>Superior Carpet &amp; Upholstery Care</b> has offered the finest carpet cleaning in Des Moines, IA and surrounding areas. 
                        We offer state of the art truck-mounted equipment combined with the right treatments, which allows us to extract dirt, stains and odors
                        from the deepest layer of your carpet.  This will remove stubborn stains and spots and keep them from returning while leaving your carpets 
                        feeling soft and new again.</p>  
                    <p>Our cleaning staff can also use the latest deodorizing treatments to keep your carpets smelling fresh.  
                        After carpets are cleaned manufacturers highly recommend an application of carpet protector to protect carpets and ensure they clean well on the next deep cleaning.
                        We can also provide this service to you!</p>
